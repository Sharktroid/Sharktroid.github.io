        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My schooling has been standard, with my elementary, middle, and high
            school all being part of Hebron CT's public schools. My college of
            choice was Quinnipiac University.</p>
        <p>My experience with computer science is that I have taken many courses
            in computer science related fields. I have also learned different
            coding languages on my own time, and have also worked on a project
            on the Godot engine on my own time as well.</p>
        <p>Besides working on my engine, I like to play video games in my spare
            time</p>
